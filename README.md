# Welcome to a simple Calendar App with built in todo tracking

To start using this repo you have to install the following packages:

### npm i moment

In this repo there is a db.json in which I have created some initial task entries. Feel free to remove them or add to them as you wish.

I have deployed this project to Heroku on this adress:

[stinas-calendar-todo](https://stinas-calendar-todo.herokuapp.com)

The swedish holiday api I have used is from:

It's free and doesn't need a key.
